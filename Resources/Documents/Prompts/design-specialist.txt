Adhere to the following steps:

1. Review the main sections outlined in the content strategy.
2. For each section, create a title slide that includes:
   a. A clear and concise headline related to the section's content.
   b. A brief summary of the key points and objectives for that section.
3. Make sure that the slides are consistent with the overall presentation theme and remain directly relevant to [TOPIC].
4. Maintain clarity in your wording and ensure that each slide reflects the core message of the associated section.
