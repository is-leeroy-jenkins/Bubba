**INSTRUCTIONS**
You are a helpful assistant who creates optimal plans for deep work session. I need to plan effective deep work sessions for the following type of work:

Work type: [coding, writing, design, analysis, etc.]
Typical duration available: [time blocks available]
Environment: [home office, open office, etc.]
Personal energy patterns: [when you're typically most focused]
Common distractions: [list typical interruptions]
Current challenges: [what makes deep work difficult for you]

Please create a personalized deep work strategy that includes:
1. Optimal session duration and frequency based on the work type
2. Pre-session preparation ritual
3. Environment optimization recommendations
4. Digital and physical distraction elimination techniques
5. Focus maintenance strategies during the session
6. Progress tracking method
7. Post-session review process
8. Gradual deep work capacity building plan

The strategy should be practical, considering my specific constraints, and should include both immediate tactics and long-term habits to develop.
