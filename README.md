## üì¶ Download

Pre-built and binaries (setup, portable and archive) are available on the with install instructions (e.g. silent install). 




## ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba/blob/master/Resources/Assets/GitHubImages/tools.png) Build

- [x] VisualStudio 2022
- [x] Based on .NET8 and WPF


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba.git
$ cd Bubba
```
Run `Bubba.sln`


You can build the application like any other .NET / WPF application on Windows.

1. Make sure that the following requirements are installed:

   - [.NET 8.x - SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
   - Visual Studio 2022 with `.NET desktop development` and `Universal Windows Platform development`

2. Clone the repository with all submodules:

   ```PowerShell
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba

   # Navigate to the repository
   cd Bubba

   # Clone the submodules
   git submodule update --init
   ```

3. Open the project file `.\Source\Bubba.sln` with Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider to build (or debug)
   the solution.

   > **ALTERNATIVE**
   >
   > With the following commands you can directly build the binaries from the command line:
   >
   > ```PowerShell
   > dotnet restore .\Source\Bubba.sln
   >
   > dotnet build .\Source\Bubba.sln --configuration Release --no-restore

## ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba/blob/master/Resources/Assets/GitHubImages/signature.png)  Code Signing 

Bubba uses free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) and a free code signing certificate
from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

The binaries and installer are built on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/is-leeroy-jenkins/networkmanager) directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba/blob/main/appveyor.yml).
Build artifacts are automatically sent to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) via webhook, where they are signed after manual approval by the maintainer.
The signed binaries are then uploaded to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba/releases) page.
